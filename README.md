# samp-query-ts
The NPM library that I self-rewrote from Javascript to TypeScript, I want to make the node-samp-query library function stably in Typescript.
# NPM Package Page
I haven't published this script in the NPM Package Library, because I haven't created an account there, so for the time being, do a manual installation via this Git Repository
# Original Script
The original script is <a href="https://github.com/Revalto/node-samp-query">Here</a>

Or you can visit the GitHub Repository https://github.com/Revalto/node-samp-query or the NPM Package Page in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-samp-query">Here</a> or https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-samp-query
